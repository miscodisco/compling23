(Though, of course, be aware of the work of people such as [James Pennebaker](http://www.secretlifeofpronouns.com/), who emphasizes how much social meaning can be conveyed by function words. Lists of common function words that you are not going to count are conventionally called **stop words** in computational work. Modify the first program to also accept a list of stop words which you don't put in the hash. Modify the top-level code so that it doesn't count `['the', 'a', 'an', 'that', 'and', 'to', 'of']`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We're starting to suffer badly from simply tokenizing by dividing on whitespace. We could do a little better by simply \"whiting out\" the commonest punctuation marks that glom on to words. Before splitting on white space, we could change the string to delete letters like: `'.', ',', '\"'`. Remember the `replace()` method on `str` that we saw last time. Look at your output, you may well want to delete a few more. Doing this will do a little textual damage; e.g., `30,000` will become `30000`, but it won't be too bad. You may want to not delete `'`, though, so that you don't damage words like `isn't`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It might also be useful to lowercase all tokens, so that words don't become different just because they are at the start of a sentence. Of course, you'll then just have to be smart enough to recognize that `irs` means the `IRS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It would be good to also add up how many non-stop words were spoken by each candidate. Who spoke the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To normalize for frequency, it would be useful to also work out the percent of times the word each candidate says is a certain word. So, in the second function, also print the percent as well as the raw count.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Find at least one interesting difference in word use between the two candidates, and put it in the cell below!"
