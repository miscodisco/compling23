If walking around my room, taking the button from the desk, putting it on another table, then pressing the button has a cost of 10 (arbitrarily)... well, that higher cost represents more effort in the case of physical effort. Costs in machine learning are similar. If an operation has a higher cost, i.e. replacing one letter versus another, then we want to avoid it. The lower the cost, the better!"
