Since the resulting values are very small, scale them by multiplying them by one thousand (1,000), then round the result to three decimals. For example, the word \"voice\" has an estimated probability of ${156,861\\over1,001,610,938}= 0.000156608$. This number multiplied by one thousand, rounded to three decimals, is 0.157.
